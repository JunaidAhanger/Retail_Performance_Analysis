## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales and profitability across regions and product categories to identify margin leakage, discount inefficiencies, and product concentration risk.

## Business Objective
Despite steady sales growth, management observed declining margins and uneven regional performance. The goal was to understand where revenue comes from, where profit is lost, and how pricing strategies impact profitability.

## Tools Used
- Excel – Initial data exploration and validation
- PostgreSQL – Data modeling and analytical transformations
- Tableau – Interactive dashboards and visual analytics

## Key Insights
- A small set of sub-categories generates the majority of total profit.
- Higher discount levels correlate with lower profit margins.
- Several high-revenue regions operate below average profitability.

## Recommendations
- Optimize discount strategies to protect margins.
- Focus growth investments on high-profit sub-categories.
- Address structural inefficiencies in underperforming regions.

## Deliverables
- Interactive Tableau dashboards
- Executive insights & recommendations PDF
